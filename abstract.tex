The Schrödinger bridge problem is concerned with finding the most likely stochastic evolution between two probability distributions given a prior/reference stochastic evolution. This problem was posed by Schrödinger in \citep{schrodinger1931uber,schrodinger1932theorie} and solved to a large extent. Problems of this kind, whilst not popular in the machine learning community, have direct applications such as Domain Adaptation, Hypothesis Testing, Semantic Similarity, and others.

Thus, the focus of this thesis is to carry out a preliminary study on computational approaches for estimating the Schrödinger bridge between two distributions, when these distributions are available (or can be available) through samples, as most problems in Machine Learning are.

Due to the mathematical nature of the problem, this manuscript is partly concerned with restating and re-deriving many theorems and results that are either overlooked within the mathematical community or hidden in type-written textbooks behind paywalls. Part of the aim of this sub-goal is to make the mathematical toolery behind these approaches more accessible to a broader scientific and engineering audience.
